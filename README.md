# In this project, I implemented a Neural Style Transfer (NST) model that applies the artistic style of a reference painting or artwork to a target content image, such as a photograph, resulting in a visually striking blend of content and style. This was achieved by leveraging the power of deep learning, specifically using a pre-trained VGG19 convolutional neural network from the PyTorch library, to extract hierarchical features from both the style and content images. The model computes content loss by comparing high-level features between the generated and content images, while style loss is calculated using Gram matrices to represent the correlation between feature maps, thus capturing the texture and color distribution of the style image. The final output is generated by iteratively updating a white noise image using gradient descent to minimize a weighted combination of content and style losses. To build and run the code, I used **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** as my primary development environment, which provided robust debugging tools, syntax highlighting, and version control integration for better code management and productivity. I utilized **ChatGPT** extensively to guide me through the project, helping me understand neural style transfer theory, refine my code, troubleshoot errors, and optimize model performance. ChatGPT also assisted me in writing modular, readable, and well-documented code by suggesting efficient Python structures and PyTorch-specific best practices. In addition, I used **Bolt AI** to generate a detailed technical prompt for the project, outlining the scope, objectives, and deliverables in a clear and structured format. Bolt AI helped accelerate my planning process by offering actionable insights and breaking down the complex problem into manageable tasks.
# Furthermore, I used other essential tools such as Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook during intermediate stages to prototype and test code quickly in a GPU-supported environment. For image loading, processing, and visualization, I incorporated the Pillow and Matplotlib libraries, ensuring that the images were properly transformed, normalized, and displayed before and after style transfer. The final deliverable includes a Python script that can be run on any machine with PyTorch installed, along with sample input images and their corresponding stylized outputs. I experimented with various artistic styles, including famous artworks like Van Gogh’s "Starry Night" and Monet’s impressionist paintings, successfully transferring their color palettes and brush stroke patterns onto high-resolution photographs. This project not only enhanced my understanding of convolutional neural networks and optimization algorithms but also improved my skills in practical coding, debugging, and machine learning workflows. By combining advanced AI tools like ChatGPT and Bolt AI with hands-on coding in VS Code, I was able to develop a complete and functional AI-powered application that demonstrates the creative potential of neural networks. The experience also gave me valuable insights into the intersection of technology and art, showcasing how artificial intelligence can be used for digital creativity and artistic expression.
